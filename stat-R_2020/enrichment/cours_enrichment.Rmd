# Two main approches

- Gene set comparisons
  - Input: a set of functionally related genes
  - Reference: a database of annotated gene functions (GO, pathways, TF targets, …)
  - Approach: evaluate the significance of the intersection (over-represented ?)
  - Stat: hypergeometric test
- Gene Set Enrichment analysis
  - Input: a sorted list of genes
  - Reference: a database of annotated gene functions (GO, pathways, TF targets, …)
  - Approach: evaluate the significance of the rank of the genes belonging to a reference class in the ordered list.
  - Stat: enrichment scores (alternative)

# Gene set comparison (over-representation of the intersection)

- A given organism has 6000 genes, 40 of which are involved in methionine metabolism. 
- A set of 10 genes were reported as co-expressed in an RNAseq experiment. Among them, 6 are related to methionine metabolism. 
- How significant is this observation ? More precisely, what would be the probability to observe such a correspondence by chance alone ?

```{r Venn diagram, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Draw a venn diagram indicating the number of genes in a 
# co-expression cluster that are involved in methionine metobolism
VennDiagram::venn.diagram(list(Genome = 1:6000, Methionine_metabolism = 1:40, coexpression_cluster = 35:44), "images/venn_yeast_methionine.png", main = "Genes in co-expressed cluster vs methionine metabolism", imagetype = "png", col = c("darkblue", "darkgreen", "darkred"), cat.col = c("darkblue", "darkgreen", "darkred"))
```

# The hypergeometric test

- Let us define
  - g = 6000	(number of genes)
  - m = 40	(genes involved in methionine metabolism)
  - n = 5960	(genes not involved in methionine metabolism)
  - k = 10	(number of genes in the cluster)
  - x = 6  (number of methionine genes in the cluster)

- We calculate the number of possibilities for the following selections
  - C1 : 10 distinct genes among 6000

    C1 = $C_{m+n}^{k} = \frac{6000!}{10!5990!} = 1.65e^{31}$
  - C2 : 6 distinct genes among the 40 involved in methionine

    C2 = $C_{m}^{x} = \frac{40!}{6!34!} = 3.8e^{6}$
  - C3 : 4 genes among the 5960 which are not involved in methionine

    C3 = $C_{n}^{k-x} = \frac{5960!}{4!5956!} = 5.2e^{13}$
  - C4 : 6 methionine and 4 non-methionine genes

    C4 = $C_{m}^{x}C_{n}^{k-x} = 2.0e^{20}$

# The hypergeometric test - probabilities

- P(X = 6): probability to have exactly 6 methionine genes within a selection of 10

  P(X=6) = $\frac{C_{m}^{x}C_{n}^{k-x}}{C_{m+n}^{k}} = 1.219e^{11}$

- P(X >= 6) : probability to have at least 6 methionine genes within a selection of 10

  P(X≥6) = $\sum_{i=x}^{k}\frac{C_{m}^{i}C_{n}^{k-i}}{C_{m+n}^{k}} = 1.222e^{11}$

# Over-representation analysis (precautions to take)

- Define your universe (background)
  - set with all the genes susceptible to be part of your analysis
- Not so simple
  - all genes in genomic annotations ?
  - all genes with at least one annotation in the ontology you used ?
  - all coding genes ?
  - genes on a biochip ?
  - genes / proteins detected by an experimental approach (RNAseq, proteomics)
  - genes reachable by your approach (ex : miRNA targets, Godard et al., 2015)
- multiple-test corrections
  - correction choice (adjusted P-values : Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg, FDR)
  - inter-test dependancies corrections (usually not taken into account in tools)
  
# GSEA
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
- since 2006
- determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states
- http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp
- MSigDB (The Molecular Signatures Database) : collection of annotated gene sets
- R package : https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSEABase.html

# GSEA principle
- All genes are sorted according to some criterion (e.g. differential expression p-value, correlation of expression with other variables, …).
- Each graph compares the ranked gene list with one reference class (e.g. one biological process).
- Black bars denote genes belonging to the reference class.
- The green curve estimates, at each level i, the degree of over-representation of the reference genes in the i top-ranking genes.
