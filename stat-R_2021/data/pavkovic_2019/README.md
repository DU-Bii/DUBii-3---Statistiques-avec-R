## Data file naming

We prepared the data from Pavkovic as a text file with tab-separated values (**tsv** files). 

All the files are available on github:
- <https://github.com/DU-Bii/module-3-Stat-R/tree/master/stat-R_2021/data/pavkovic_2019>

The files are named according to the following convention:

- the prefix indicate the data type

    - **fa**: folic acid induced nephropathy (reversible), transcriptome data
    - **pfa**: folic acid induced nephropathy, proteome data
    - **uuo**: unilateral uretral obstruction (irreversible), transcriptome data
    - **puuo**: unilateral uretral obstruction, proteome data

- The suffix indicates the data  normalisation

    - **raw**: transcriptome counts provided by the authors (note: not integer, because their raw data was already somehow normalized)
    - **normalizedÂ¨**: transcriptome counts standardized to achieve the same third quartile for each sample
    - **log2**: log2 transformation for proteome data
    
- the  **metadata** files contain a short description of each sample (one row per sample). Note that the last column contains a sample-specific color specification in [hexadecimal web color code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) to facilitate the drawings. Don't hesitate to chose [other colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) according to your personal taste.
